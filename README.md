**Introduction**

**Tigon** is an open-source, real-time, low-latency, high-throughput stream processing framework.

Tigon is a collaborative effort between Cask Data, Inc. and AT&T that combines 
technologies from these companies to create a disruptive new framework to handle a diverse
set of real-time streaming requirements.

Cask Data has built technology that provides scalable, reliable, and persistent high-throughput
event processing with high-level Java APIs using Hadoop and HBase.

AT&T has built a streaming engine that provides massively scalable, flexible, and in-memory
low-latency stream processing with a SQL-like query Language.

Together, they have combined to create **Tigon**.
